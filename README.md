# MNIST-AI-Model
This project classifies handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using a pretrained ResNet-18 model in PyTorch. I used PyTorchâ€™s Dataset and DataLoader, applied transformations, and trained the model with the Adam optimizer and Cross Entropy Loss. The final total loss was 0.08%.
